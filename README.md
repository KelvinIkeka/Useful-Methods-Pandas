# Useful-Methods-Pandas
Covers some useful methods and functions built in to pandas. This is actually just a small sampling of the functions and methods available in Pandas, but they are some of the most commonly used. The documentation is a great resource to continue exploring more methods and functions (we will introduce more further along in the course). Here is a list of functions and methods we'll cover here:

apply() method
apply() with a function
apply() with a lambda expression
apply() on multiple columns
describe()
sort_values()
corr()
idxmin and idxmax
value_counts
